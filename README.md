# Amy.bo's new website

Amy.bo is a non-profit open source protein fermentation community - and this is the 'new', yet-to-be-deployed website. Check out the ['website refresh' thread on the Amy.bo forum](https://forum.amybo.org/t/website-refresh/132/9) for more context and how you can get involved.

## Status

ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - please [see the issues board to get an idea of what needs doing](https://github.com/users/myndrws/projects/3/views/1), and get started on one of these if you'd like to help out!

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

The image free-forest.jpg is a freely available, and subsequently edited, photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ozarkdrones?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Ozark Drones</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/birds-eye-view-photo-of-trees-jeV-LUEyJoE?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.
      

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
